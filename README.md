# First_code_with_me

This is my very first Python program ðŸŽ‰  

## About Python
- Python is a high-level programming language.  
- It is human understandable and easy to learn.  
- Python code is interpreted and executed line by line.  
- If thereâ€™s an error, execution stops, so debugging is easier.  
- It has very simple syntax (almost like English).  

## Code Example
```python
print("Namaskara Karnataka")


```
