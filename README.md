# First_code_with_me

This is my very first Python program ðŸŽ‰  

## About Python
- Python is a high-level programming language.  
- It is human understandable and easy to learn.  
- Python code is interpreted and executed line by line.  
- If thereâ€™s an error, execution stops, so debugging is easier.  
- It has very simple syntax (almost like English).  

## Code Example
```python
print("Namaskara Karnataka")


```

How to Run

Install Python (if not installed) â†’ Download here

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Hegde1527/Simple_code_with_Me.git


Navigate to the folder:

cd Simple_code_with_Me



## Program 2: Variables and Addition

This program explains how variables work in Python.  

### Code
```python
a = 10
b = 20
print(a)
print(b)
print("a")
print(a + b)

```
Run the Python file:

python p2.py

* Variables are containers that hold data values.

* a = 10, b = 20 â†’ assigning values to variables.

* print(a) â†’ prints the value stored in a (10).

* print("a") â†’ prints the letter a, not the value.

* print(a+b) â†’ adds the values of a and b (10 + 20 = 30).
